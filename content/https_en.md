Went 2015 year, everyone moves their services from HTTP to HTTPS. And because cool guys from [StartSSL](http://www.startssl.com/) give valid certificates for free, I have decided to make the site be accessible through https. Since I would need to generate static content with pelican twice (for http and https) I have decided to make the site be available only through HTTPS. If it makes troubles to someone, please, let me know.
